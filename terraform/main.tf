/*
If removing the Condition block from the S3 bucket policy allows your setup to continue working, 
it indicates that your bucket policy is already permissive enough to accept requests from CloudFront without further validation of the AWS:SourceArn condition. 

Without the Condition block:

The S3 bucket allows all requests from the cloudfront.amazonaws.com principal, regardless of which CloudFront distribution they originate from.
The bucket policy still restricts access to CloudFront as a service, but it doesn't verify that the requests specifically come from your CloudFront distribution ARN.

Why Does It Work?
CloudFront-Origin-Signed Requests Are Still Valid:

The OAC ensures that all requests from CloudFront to the S3 bucket are signed and authenticated using AWS SigV4.
These signed requests satisfy the bucket policy's requirement for the cloudfront.amazonaws.com principal to perform s3:GetObject.
No Strict Validation of AWS:SourceArn:

Without the Condition block, the policy doesn't check if the requests are coming from your specific CloudFront distribution. It implicitly trusts all CloudFront distributions.
Minimal Policy Requirement:

The absence of the Condition makes the policy less restrictive, but CloudFront's signed requests still ensure that only CloudFront can access the S3 bucket.

Potential Risks of Removing Condition
Overly Broad Access:

Any CloudFront distribution (not just yours) could access your S3 bucket if they have the appropriate Signed URLs or keys.
This is not an immediate concern in most cases since CloudFront-S3 integrations are still authenticated via OAC and Signed URLs.
Violation of Principle of Least Privilege:

It's a best practice to restrict access as much as possible. By removing the Condition, you're allowing a broader range of CloudFront distributions to potentially access your bucket.

Should You Keep It?
Keep the Condition if:

You want to adhere to AWS security best practices and follow the Principle of Least Privilege.
You want to ensure that your S3 bucket is accessible only by your specific CloudFront distribution.
You can remove the Condition if:

You prioritize simplicity over strict security constraints.
You understand the risks of broader access and are confident that Signed URLs and OAC provide sufficient security.




*/

/*
^
|
Principal with Service = "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"

Ensures that only CloudFront can access your S3 bucket.
This is required for OAC or OAI.
No Condition Block

Flow:

The Signed URL is validated by CloudFront, ensuring only authorized users can proceed.
Once CloudFront approves the request, it forwards the request to the S3 bucket using the OAC credentials, which are validated against the bucket policy.

Why This Configuration is Safe
Your current bucket policy ensures:

Only CloudFront Requests: The Principal is set to cloudfront.amazonaws.com, meaning the bucket only accepts requests from CloudFront.
Specific Distribution Access: The Condition ensures only your specific CloudFront distribution (using its ARN) can access the bucket.
Supports CloudFront Signed URLs: Since the request goes through CloudFront, the signed URL mechanism integrates seamlessly.

  /*
What is origin_access_control_id?
This parameter links your CloudFront distribution to an Origin Access Control (OAC). OAC is a mechanism that:

Allows CloudFront to securely access your S3 bucket.
Prevents direct public access to the S3 bucket by requiring all access to go through CloudFront.
Signs requests from CloudFront to S3 using AWS SigV4 (signature version 4), authenticating CloudFront as the source of the request.
When the origin_access_control_id is added, the connection between CloudFront and the S3 bucket uses these credentials, ensuring the S3 bucket trusts requests coming from CloudFront.

Why Access Denied Without origin_access_control_id?
No Trust Between S3 and CloudFront:

Without origin_access_control_id, the S3 bucket does not recognize CloudFront as a trusted entity.
Even if you allow cloudfront.amazonaws.com in the bucket policy, the requests to S3 do not carry sufficient authentication details unless they are signed with OAC.
Request Source Misalignment:

S3 requires requests to come from an authenticated and authorized source (like OAC). Without it, S3 cannot verify that the request truly originates from your CloudFront distribution.
Signed URL Alone is Not Enough:

The CloudFront Signed URL only authenticates the user to CloudFront.
When CloudFront forwards the request to S3, the bucket must independently validate the request. This validation requires OAC or a similar mechanism like S3 bucket policies specifically allowing CloudFront.

Why It Works with OAC
When origin_access_control_id is added:

CloudFront Signs Requests to S3:

CloudFront uses the OAC credentials to sign requests sent to the S3 bucket.
This signature (AWS SigV4) contains the necessary authorization details, including the origin (CloudFront distribution ARN).
S3 Recognizes and Trusts the Request:

Your S3 bucket policy now works as expected because it validates the AWS:SourceArn condition against the CloudFront distribution ARN.
S3 trusts the authenticated requests coming through CloudFront, ensuring secure access.
Seamless Integration:

The Signed URL ensures users are authorized to access CloudFront.
The OAC ensures CloudFront is authorized to access S3, completing the chain of trust.

----

Benefits of Using OAC
Enhanced Security:

Ensures no direct access to the S3 bucket, even with valid Signed URLs.
Prevents unauthorized requests to the bucket by enforcing trust at every step.
Simplified Bucket Policy:

You only need to allow access for cloudfront.amazonaws.com with the specific AWS:SourceArn, avoiding overly permissive policies.
Best Practice Compliance:

Aligns with AWS recommendations for securing S3 buckets behind CloudFront.

----

In Summary
The addition of origin_access_control_id ensures:

Trust between CloudFront and S3.
Proper authentication and authorization of requests from CloudFront to S3.
A secure and functional integration between CloudFront Signed URLs and your S3 bucket.

Why AWS_PROXY Needs Lambda to Handle CORS
With AWS_PROXY, API Gateway directly forwards all requests to the Lambda function without applying transformation, including OPTIONS preflight requests. Thus:

CORS headers for OPTIONS must be returned by the Lambda function.
API Gateway does not process the response_parameters for CORS like it does with a non-PROXY integration.
*/

/*
Keep the OPTIONS method defined, but let it pass through the Lambda function. 
Do not define a MOCK integration for the OPTIONS method.
